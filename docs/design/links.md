## docker stack and env files

- `docker stack deploy` in 1.13 doesn't load `.env` file as `docker-compose up` does

  - https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29133#issuecomment-265038663
    - Otherwise, we have to prefix export in each line of .env file and manually source .env every time before loading the docker-compose.yml, and the extra steps sometimes are prone to mistake.

## ipfs EnableAutoRelay, libp2p Circuit relay

- https://blog.aira.life/understanding-ipfs-circuit-relay-ccc7d2a39
  - > Relay is needed when there are two nodes in the topology of our network (QmOne and QmTwo), a direct connection between which is impossible (for example, both are behind NAT), but the connection must be established. In this situation, a special proxy node is selected that proxies the connection from one node to another and vice versa.

## auto discovery with multiple docker networks: only one network is listed in “swarm addrs local”

- https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/auto-discovery-with-multiple-docker-networks-only-one-network-is-listed-in-swarm-addrs-local/9418
- https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/1025

- To sum up current status (using go-ipfs#v0.7.0 and repsectively go-libp2p#v0.11.0 go-libp2p-swarm#0.2.8)
- did fork and run and indeed - `makeAddrsFactory` https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/v0.7.0/core/node/libp2p/addrs.go#L28 returns `go-libp2p-swarm/swarm_addr.go#AllAddrs` when Announce/NoAnnounce are empty
- this is where the node gets `local` and `listen` addresses
    - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/v0.7.0/core/coreapi/swarm.go#L96
- `listen` come from `InterfaceListenAddresses` in go-libp2p-swarm
    - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/blob/v0.2.8/swarm_addr.go#L30
- `local` come from `AllAddrs` in go-libp2p (that's where all the logic and filtering is)
    - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/v0.11.0/p2p/host/basic/basic_host.go#L793
- will explore further to make it so that all docker networks are within  `core/coreapi/swarm#LocalAddrs`.
- the focus is on [`AllAddrs`](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/v0.11.0/p2p/host/basic/basic_host.go#L793), this where IPs get filtered out.
~~*There is always a monkey-patch option of making `core/coreapi/swarm#LocalAddrs` return merged `InterfaceListenAddresses` and `AllAddrs`, but this is a hack we need to avoid.~~ (would not matter, coreapi/swarm has no effect on actual discovery)
