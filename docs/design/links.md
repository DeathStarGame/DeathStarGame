## docker stack and env files

- `docker stack deploy` in 1.13 doesn't load `.env` file as `docker-compose up` does
  - https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29133
  - https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29133#issuecomment-265038663
    - Otherwise, we have to prefix export in each line of .env file and manually source .env every time before loading the docker-compose.yml, and the extra steps sometimes are prone to mistake.

    - env $(cat .env | grep ^[A-Z] | xargs) docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml [STACK_NAME]
    - That way, variables don't get stuck on the terminal window

## ipfs relay

- https://blog.aira.life/understanding-ipfs-circuit-relay-ccc7d2a39
  - > Relay is needed when there are two nodes in the topology of our network (QmOne and QmTwo), a direct connection between which is impossible (for example, both are behind NAT), but the connection must be established. In this situation, a special proxy node is selected that proxies the connection from one node to another and vice versa.
