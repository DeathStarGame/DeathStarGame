## every video starts with the same journey summary

- 10-30 seconds, same as in Long Way Up
- what project is and waht is the goal

## facial reactions in subframe on what is happening on screen

- for example, "really?" reaction on some usual BS

## in general, parts of videos may be cut as if live streaming highlights (with camera in the corner)

- for reactions/comments
- or even: to point with hands at things on screen
