## every video starts with the same journey summary

- 10-30 seconds, same as in Long Way Up
- what project is and waht is the goal

## facial reactions in subframe on what is happening on screen

- for example, "really?" reaction on some usual BS

## in general, parts of videos may be cut as if live streaming highlights (with camera in the corner)

- for reactions/comments
- or even: to point with hands at things on screen

## focus on project's journey, not on self, no bla-bla drag

- simple: use video editiing to create entertaining light-shedding video about the project's journey
- narration, comments similar to documentaries, serve the purpose
- but without boring pseudo-politeness: speaking out to and over the edge, show real emotions
- at the same time doing it dynamically and consicely, without occupying time for self-imporatance reasons
- pace it out to keep the project in the center, with self-humor, humility, openess, no bla-bla drag
