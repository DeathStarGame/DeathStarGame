# lab.weekend-2020-07-23

- invited a friend for a visit next week, to critique and debate the idea of such a game
- naturally I feel dared!
- so self-generated childish challenge accepted: make a version of a game to play when friend arrives, so he could realize the fututre of this kind of games

## rationale

- none :)

## design

- what should happen when friend arrives
    - friend brings his laptop, we install him an editor
    - we clone the repo and start the game from code on his laptop and mine
    - then connect and play a scenario, after which he concedes and proclaims this kind of games 'great' :)
    - a scenario must be fun, yet dead simple, such that a person with no knowledge of the language could learn in 5 min how to play this scenario
- what to avoid
    - solving f-ing fundamental problems
    - "to build this on a weekend, stupid-simple it kept must be" Yoda, 2020
- any rational reasons why this will work ?
    - I've got clojure, clojurescript and core.async, so I can build anything
