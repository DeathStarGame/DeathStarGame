- peer-to-peer global decentralized: users that have the app running form the global network for playing
- experimental: TIE-Fighter is a scout of DeathStarGame, it takes risks, is being played right away, unready, unfinished
- closely 1-to-1 follows and applies DeathStarGame design choices
- competetive: there are games and eventually there are tournaments
- solo and teams
