- invited a friend to visit next week, to critique and debate the idea of such a game
- naturally I feel dared!
- so self-generated childish challenge accepted: make a version of a game to play when friend arrives, so he could realize the fututre of this kind of games

## rationale

- none :)

## design

- what should happen when friend arrives
    - friend brings his laptop, we install him an editor
    - we glone the code and start the game from code
    - connect to my laptop and play a scenario, after which he concedes and proclaims this kind of games 'great' :)
    - a scenario must be fun, yet dead simple, so that a person with no knowledge of the language could learn in 5 min how to play this scenario
