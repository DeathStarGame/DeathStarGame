## on being able to play events before the volunteer auto cluster (origin) exists

- auto-cluster is a higher level abstraction that is closer to an ideal tool, but not a blockng requirement
- the goal, clearly is to have events , so what's the approach ?
- per-event hosting: well, it's just LAN, but with event system included
    - an event is announced and discussed via existing public methods of communication
    - event organizer launches the system (which is open source and one command lauchnable in docker)
    - event organizer may or may not choose invitational format or open access
    - so either the ip/domain is publicly announced or is sent to the players/observers only
    - event is played and streamed, after the event orgnaizer may choose to upload the game data for public access
- identity is an issue with such approach, as system starts fresh, but it is, again, non blocking, a future goal
