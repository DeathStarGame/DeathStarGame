paradigm

- 4 factions: 
  - plex (red and black, complicated steel like structures, control)
  - vitaal (lazure blue, white,energy - highly eveolved)
  - abstract (shadowy)
  - tribes (multicolor, patchy, small ships)
- triplanetary system

abstract

- were before plex
- academic, learners
- want to learn to detroy spacetime
- willingly use plex as workforce

vitaal

- the only who can use datum particles 
- abstract want to obtain that knowledge
- build most advacned ships, use enegry and datum particles
- learned there is a a planet with inofromation on how to do intergalactic travels
- so did plex and tribes - both searching for it; abstract think it's insignificant in comparison to disovling spacetime

tribes

- mostly live on the outer rim
- build light small ships, from parts and pieces, multicolor, patchy style
- move in fleets
- always opressed by plex to work for them
- don't like vitaal, plex or abstract

plex

- complex, bureaucratic, control
- build most coplicated enormous structures, heavy, colors of red and steel
- so complex, they can only be maintained by countless workforce
- hate vitaal and are respectful to abstract, despise tribes
- want to take over everything

scenario gameplay

- we have a map of space - planets and fleets (light and colorful and disctict, but with a scent of of Imperium Galactica 2)
- it's like Homm3 strategy, we porgram fleets and planets, battles and conquest victory
- can program like "over the next 10 cycles, this fleet move there and there, and if that and that, go south instead"
- so we look at the map, what planet and fleet positions are and define there behavior for next simulation cycle, then see fleets combat, resources collected etc.

get to the ship

- idea of a movie: a few heroes from different planents acciednetally unite (with their own motives) but end up looking for the vitaal ship
- when they find it, with high hopes, there is a lost-hope vitaal there who tells that vitaal dismatled, and are mostly a myth now
