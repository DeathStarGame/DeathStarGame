name

- Death Star Game

> Finally the name of the game emerged - Death Star!
So many years, so many attempts, failing: freeverse, openmove, paradigm, starnet, express-in-code(excode) etc.
But they all were too dy, yawn, unleavened. Just tasteless.
Death Star is a reference, homage to a great classics. Standing on the shoulders of giants. 
And it's juicy and fun.
Plus, Death Star resembles a computer system.
Not to mention, the theme - perfect for the programming game - droids, space and stuff like that. But not limiting.
