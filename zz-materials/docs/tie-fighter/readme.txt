about

- tie-fighter is smaller, it's a scout of Death Star https://github.com/DeathStarGame/DeathStarGame
- peer-to-peer global decentralized: users that have the app running form the global network for playing
- experimental: tie-fighter is a scout of DeathStarGame, it takes risks, is being played right away, unready, unfinished, one level below something Jesus would play
- follows DeathStarGame design trajectory, but probes and takes detours, glues things to make it work
- competetive: there are games and eventually there are tournaments
- 1v1s and teams
